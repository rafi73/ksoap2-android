My apologies for the long hiatus in updates to this project.  I was actually quite surprised to discover today that others were making use of it.  I just pushed out a new release (2.3) to resolve the issues folks were having making use of it.

If you'd like to help contribute to this project, please let me know.  I'll try to put up a page with build instructions sometime in the near future.
