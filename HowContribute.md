# How to contribute code #

In order for any code contributions to be applied to the project easily we would recommend that you develop your enhancement or fix against the latest code base on github.

You can do that either

  * by downloading or cloning the project source yourself and providing a patch file.

or by

  * cloning the project on github into you own account on github and creating a a pull request

Help for using github can be found aplenty on the [github site](http://help.github.com)
